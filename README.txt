WHAT IS IT?
Mail Defense! is a slightly-abstract action game in which you play a
lone mailman defending the US Postal Service against Communist
infiltrators.  You must lay mail bombs to stop the waves of enemies
trying to converge on the main mailbox in the center of the map.  The
longer you stay alive, the more points you get, the more levels you
advance, the more dirty Commies you kill!

Our next game will involve the Communists' plot to put fluoride in the
water supply.

HOW TO PLAY:
Waves of enemies appear on the edges of the playing area.  There is
one enemy to a side, or front.  Run around with the arrow keys and lay
the right mail bomb on each front to kill said enemy with the keys 1,
2, 3, or 4.  If any front reaches the inner defenses of the mail
mailbox, you lose!  If there are two of the same kind of enemy on 2
adjacent fronts, lay one bomb between them to kill them both!  Collect
powerups (little letters) when you can to gain points and kill enemies
(although they might just explode your bombs instantly...)  There are
5 levels, each crazier than the next - if you can complete them all,
hats of to you, Brave Mailman.
